# Twitter-Pronoun-Retweet-Graph-Analysis
This is a comprehensive analysis of a large Twitter Retweet Graph in which we try to investigate differences in users that do and do not specify their preferred gender-pronoun in their twitter-Bio  

This analysis is based on s Dataset from the following paper:  
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08977.pdf

Unlike the original paper, this project analyzed the characteristics of users that declare their pronouns (such as "she/her") in their Twitter-Bio. More specifically, we aim to find out whether users who declare their gender-pronouns in their bio more likely to retweet users who do the same.

This project is divided into three parts:  
- A wrangling/feature engineering part, where we take a first look at the data and engineer various features  
- EDA part, where we visually investigate different aspects of the data   
- And a final part where we try to answer our original research question. 

An anonymized version of the Nodes and Edges dataset that include the pronoun Variables can be downloaded here:
